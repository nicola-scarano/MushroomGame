Mush is a game that analyzes environmental volume: If environment is not very loudy ( if it does not exeeds the treshold valume value ) mushrooms are growing during the session.

We adapted this concept into a classroom environment. If a group of students are not very laudy during the class session mushrooms grow. 

Students are awarded with the breaktime : 
  students can take a break as long as the amount of mushrooms they grow.
  
  For volume measurement rcaudio (https://github.com/mhy12345/rcaudio) is used.
  
  For game part pygame library is used.
